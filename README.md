ML-ready antimicrobial resistance (AMR) dataset derived from African Klebsiella pneumoniae genomes, curated for machine learning and benchmarking.
# African Klebsiella pneumoniae AMR ML Dataset

This repository documents a **machine learning–ready antimicrobial resistance (AMR) dataset**
derived from African *Klebsiella pneumoniae* genomes.

The dataset is curated to support:
- ML model prototyping
- Benchmarking
- Teaching and demonstrations

---

## Public Prototype (Free)

The public release includes:
- 20 isolates
- Binary AMR gene presence/absence matrix
- Clean metadata (country, host, isolation source where available)
- One row per isolate
- One column per AMR gene feature

This subset is intentionally limited and suitable for rapid experimentation.

---

## Why this dataset matters

- African AMR genomic data is severely underrepresented
- Most ML benchmarks rely on non-African datasets
- Region-specific signals are often lost in global aggregates

This dataset enables exploratory and comparative ML analysis using African-derived data.

---

## Extended Curated Dataset

The public prototype represents a **small subset** of a larger curated dataset.

Extended releases include:
- Larger isolate collections
- Improved metadata completeness
- Versioned releases
- Structured usage terms
